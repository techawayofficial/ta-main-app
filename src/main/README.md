# Core Electron Application

## 1. Main.ts `main.ts`
The `main.ts` file in this repository is used to set up and manage the main process of an Electron application. Here are its key functions:

- **Electron Main Process**: This module runs inside Electron's main process and is responsible for starting the renderer process and handling communication between processes using IPC (Inter-Process Communication).
- **Application Updater**: Implements an updater (`AppUpdater`) that uses `electron-updater` to check for updates and notify the user.
- **Window Management**: Creates and manages the main application window, including configuring its properties (size, icon, preload script), loading the initial HTML file, and handling window events.
- **Development Tools**: Installs development extensions like React Developer Tools when in development mode.
- **Menu Building**: Constructs and sets the application menu using the `MenuBuilder` class.
- **Auto Updates**: Initiates the auto-update process if the app uses auto-updates.
- **Event Listeners**: Adds event listeners to handle application lifecycle events such as window closing and application activation.

This file is compiled to `./src/main.js` using Webpack, optimizing performance for the production build.

## 2. Menu.ts `menu.ts`
The `menu.ts` file in your repository is used to create and manage the application menu for an Electron application. Here's a breakdown of its key functionalities:

1. **MenuBuilder Class**: This class is responsible for building and setting the application menu.
    - **Constructor**: Takes an instance of `BrowserWindow` and assigns it to `this.mainWindow`.
    - **buildMenu()**: Builds the menu based on the operating system (macOS or others) and environment (development or production). It calls `setupDevelopmentEnvironment()` if in development mode and sets up the appropriate menu template.
    - **setupDevelopmentEnvironment()**: Adds a context menu with an "Inspect element" option in development mode.
    - **buildDarwinTemplate()**: Constructs the menu template for macOS, including standard menus like "File", "Edit", "View", "Window", and "Help".
    - **buildDefaultTemplate()**: Constructs the default menu template for other operating systems, including menus like "File", "View", and "Help".

2. **Menu Items**: The file defines various menu items and their actions, such as:
    - **Reload**: Reloads the window's contents.
    - **Toggle Full Screen**: Toggles the window between full-screen mode and normal mode.
    - **Toggle Developer Tools**: Opens or closes the developer tools.
    - **Open**: Placeholder for opening files.
    - **Close**: Closes the main window.
    - **About**: Provides information about the application.
    - **Help**: Provides links to external resources like documentation, community discussions, and issue tracking.

Overall, this file is essential for setting up the user interface menus in an Electron application, providing both basic navigation and developer tools access.
